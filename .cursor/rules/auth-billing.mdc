# Authentication & Billing

- User authentication is handled via Supabase (email/password) using [lib/supabaseClient.ts](mdc:lib/supabaseClient.ts).
- Paid subscriptions are managed via Stripe, integrated through Supabase and [lib/stripeClient.ts](mdc:lib/stripeClient.ts).
- Free tier: first 5 questions free for up to 5 distinct practice tests; remaining questions are locked until upgrade.
- Secure API routes for payments and test data.
- Use Supabase RLS for securing user data.
