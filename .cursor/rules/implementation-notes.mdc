# Implementation Notes

- Use shadcn/ui for all UI components.
- Use Supabase client for data fetching and authentication.
- Use Supabase RLS for securing user data.
- Use Stripe via Supabase for paid access.
- Modularize React components.
- Use environment variables for all secrets and API keys.
- Ensure all routes and API endpoints are secure.
- The ThemeSwitcher component **must be present on the homepage and every page created in the future** for consistent theme switching.
- The ThemeSwitcher **must use next-themes for theme management and lucide-react icons for light, dark, and system**.
- Do **not** use `.mjs` file extension for config files. Use `.js` instead for all config files.
