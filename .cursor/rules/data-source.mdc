# Data Source & CSV Handling

- Four CSVs (`people.csv`, `values.csv`, `government.csv`, `beliefs.csv`) are stored in AWS S3.
- Use the AWS SDK in [lib/awsS3.ts](mdc:lib/awsS3.ts) to fetch CSVs.
- Use Papaparse in [utils/parseCsv.ts](mdc:utils/parseCsv.ts) to parse CSVs.
- Parsed questions should be cached server-side for performance.
