# Navigation & Global Stats

## Navigation
- Implement in @components/Layout.tsx.
- Include links to:
  - Homepage.
  - Dashboard.
  - Practice tests.
- Ensure responsive design with a mobile-friendly header/sidebar.
- Include ThemeSwitcher component in navigation.

## Global Stats
- Display on homepage or dashboard:
  - Total users.
  - Total tests taken.
  - Total Reviews
- Fetch stats server-side using Supabase queries.
- Secure data access with Supabase RLS.

## Best Practices
- Use shadcn/ui for navigation components (e.g., dropdowns, sidebars).
- Ensure navigation is accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard support).
- Optimize stats queries for performance.
